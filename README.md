# Crypto Welt

This is a website built with React JS in the Frontend side, and the styling was used the Ant design Framework. It has a Navbar in the left side to choose between Homepage, Cryptocurrencies and News about the crypto world.

The Web site App is hosted on Netlify, the link to access is to look at it is: [https://cryptowelt.netlify.app](https://cryptowelt.netlify.app).

The data is been taken from 2 external APIs that are listed in Rapid API. One API with all the data of cryptos from Coinranking, and the news with another API from Bing News.

The API [Coinranking](https://rapidapi.com/Coinranking/api/coinranking1/) was used to get Crypto prices and other statistics.

The API [Bing News Search API](https://rapidapi.com/microsoft-azure-org-microsoft-cognitive-services/api/bing-news-search1/) was used to get up to date information about the cryptocurrencies.
